      <p>I'm really sorry, didiiw. 😔 I know this isn’t the first time I’ve let you down. I get that I was wrong for staying in touch with my ex, even if my only intention was to end things properly. I understand it hurt you, and I feel so bad about it. 😞 I love you ❤️, and I’m really sorry for making you feel this way. 🥺.</p>
